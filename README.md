# Migratio

Migratio is a versatile yet straightforward migration library that streamlines data migration across multiple platforms. It provides a uniform API, eliminating the necessity for multiple migration libraries. Currently, Migratio supports the following migration platforms:
- [Configuration](migratio-config)
  - [Configurate Extension](migratio-config/migratio-configurate)
- [Database](migratio-database)
